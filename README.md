# LeetCodeTests
Testing my solutions for the LeetCode 75 challenge.

Mock interview using Leetcode 75 challenge. Mentor provided algorithm questions 
and a 1 hour time to solve. If not completed in that hour, I uploaded the final 
solution to a dedicated slack channel when complete. These playgrounds are where 
I tested my solutions before submitting them to Leetcode and my mentor. I kept 
notes and ideas for solutions in the comments.
